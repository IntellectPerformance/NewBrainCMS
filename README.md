# NewBrainCMS
 The superior version!
 
# NewBrainCMS Project
 We thought the default BrainCMS didn't received any updates. <br> So why not updating it by our self?
 <br>
 There is not much to say about, other than the current NewBrain version is not completed and will be kept updated.
 
# BetterPHP Class 
  We made a class for registering specific Brain Variables to make it look better.<br>
  Instead of:  User::userData('username'); it now is $brainUserData->userName;
# Routing
  Yes, NewBrain uses some sort of routing to load its files, so when adding new pages, make sure to include it in the Route.php file.
